journal_text: "Realized I prefer physical books to digital ones"
type: note

I was thinking today about how much more I enjoy reading physical books compared to digital ones. There's something about the tactile experience - the weight of the book, the smell of the pages, the satisfaction of turning each page.

Maybe it's because I spend so much time looking at screens for work that my brain craves the analog experience when I'm trying to relax and learn.

I should make more time for reading this summer.
