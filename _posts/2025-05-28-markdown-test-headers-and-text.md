## Text Formatting Examples

Here's a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also combine them for ***bold and italic*** text.

Use `inline code` for short code snippets or technical terms.

~~Strikethrough text~~ is useful for showing corrections or deletions.

You can create ==highlighted text== (if supported by your Markdown processor).

> This is a blockquote. Blockquotes are perfect for emphasizing important information or quoting other sources.

> You can have multiple paragraphs in blockquotes.
>
> Just add a blank line with a `>` character.

## Links and References

Here's a [basic link](https://example.com) and here's a [link with title](https://example.com "Example Website").

You can also create reference-style links like [this one][ref1] and [this other one][ref2].

[ref1]: https://example.com "First Reference"
[ref2]: https://github.com "GitHub"

## Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules

You can create line breaks by ending a line with two spaces  
like this.

Or you can use a blank line to create a new paragraph.

Horizontal rules can be created with three or more hyphens:

Or asterisks:

***

Or underscores:

\*This text is not italic\*
\`This is not code\`
\[This is not a link\]
